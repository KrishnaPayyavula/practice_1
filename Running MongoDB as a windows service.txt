Steps to follow for running the mongod service as windows service

___________________________________________________________________

START THE SERVICE AUTOMATICALLY ON SYSTEM REBOOT / RESTART

MongoDB Install
Windows
(1) Install MongoDB

(2) Add bin to path

(3) Create c:\data\db

(4) Create c:\data\log

(5) Create c:\data\mongod.cfg with contents ..

systemLog:
    destination: file
    path: c:\data\log\mongod.log
storage:
    dbPath: c:\data\db
(6) To create service that will auto start on reboot .. RUN AS ADMIN ..

sc.exe create MongoDB binPath= "\"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe\" --service --config=\"C:\data\mongod.cfg\"" DisplayName= "MongoDB" start= "auto"
(7) Start the service .. RUN AS ADMIN ..

net start MongoDB
IMPORTANT: Even if this says 'The MongoDB service was started successfully' it can fail

To double check open Control Panel > Services, ensure the status of the MongoDB service is 'Running'

If not, check your log file at C:\data\log\mongod.log for the reason for failure and fix it

(Do not start MongoDB via Control Panel > Services, use .. net start MongoDB)

(8) Finally, restart your machine with MongoDB running and it will still be running on restart

If you ever want to kill it ..

net stop MongoDB

sc.exe delete MongoDB
